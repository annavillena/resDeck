# React Landing Page Prototype
## Made in CRA, which kind of sucks.

To run the app, do the following:
```
npm install
npm start
```

I am still working on this (hopefully).  A lot of alignments are currently hard-coded, so will not always look good.  I took the SVGs for the logo and resume illustration from Figma.

All code that is visible is in ```src/App.js```, ```src/App.css```.

Dependencies:
* [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)
